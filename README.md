## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend engineer based in Cape Town, South Africa.

I recently started publishing articles (secretly) on Medium. I'm turning what started as my personal notes into public resources I wish I had when learning something for the first time. It's called ["Backend Basics"](https://backendbasics.medium.com/) - keep an eye out for more as I continue to add more.
