## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend engineer who loves solving complex problems.

### Technical writing
One of the ways I solidify my understanding of backend concepts is by simplifying and documenting them. That's why I started writing ["Backend Basics"](https://backendbasics.medium.com/). The goal is to ease the learning journey for those encountering concepts for the first time. While initially personal notes, I've started publishing some. Feel free to have a look and keep an eye out for more coming soon.
